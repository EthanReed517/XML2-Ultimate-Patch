[size=12pt][b][u]Update[/u][/b][/size]
    I wasn't able to make an update at the end of August, so I went ahead and combined the August update with September's to give you all a full scoop on what's going on! The biggest update is maps; over the last 2 months, we've set up all the maps for Act 1 and Act 2, bringing the count of maps for Phase 1 up from 11 to 37! Over 1/3 of the maps are done now. Tentatively, I think Phase 1 can be completed by the end of the year.
    On the side, I'm also working on some other things that will impact the X2UP indirectly. I'm currently revising igbFinisher to greatly streamline the skinning process. This means that I'll be able to create skins faster when Phase 2 is in full swing. This is requiring me to do some work on the Marvel Mods GIMP Scripts and the Marvel Mods Modeling Tutorial, but once that's all together, I'll be able to complete many more skins!
