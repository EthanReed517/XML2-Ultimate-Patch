    Phase 1 is officially complete! This is a huge milestone for the project and something that's been in the works for a long time, so I'm very happy to have it complete. This gives us the flexibility to work on any asset from the game without having to decompile everything. It will also make it much easier to convert the project to the other consoles in the future.
    With Phase 1 complete, we can now work on Phase 2 in fully force. I've updated the progress tracker on the first post to include some more detail on what's left for this phase to be complete. There are lots of skins still for me to do, and various other things we need to comb through and implement.
