    Phase 1 is almost done! All of the maps for act 4 are now done, bringing the count to 85. To finish out, we have to set up the act 5 maps, danger room maps, and various random lingering files.
    You may have noticed that the counts for certain asset types have increased within Phase 1. This is because XML2 has a lot of unused, duplicate, and test assets in its files, so it's tricky to get a clear picture of exactly what's used in the game. As we go on, we've gotten a better idea by comparing what's present on all versions of the game and what's interrelated, giving us a clearer picture.
