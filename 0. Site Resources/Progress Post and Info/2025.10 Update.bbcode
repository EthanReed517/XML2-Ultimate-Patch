    We're getting closer to closing out Phase 1! We currently have 63 out of 97 maps transferred, which includes all of the Act 3 maps. It's looking like Phase 1 can be wrapped up by the end of this year! We've also been putting work into smaller aspects of Phase 2; character updates keep coming, and changes to maps have been happening too. Outside of that, my progress on the tutorials and tools that I mentioned last month is still continuing, and I'm hoping to have those updates complete by the end of this year as well.
