The cutscene concept art, which was done by Blur Studio, is all unlocked when you complete the game for the first time, and all of it is unlocked at once. The "unlock all concept art" cheat code doesn't unlock them.

Below are the review entries for the bonus concept art if you wish to use any of those.

Replace the "XX" with the number of whichever concept art you want to replace and swap out the review_paths entry.

For the "Wolverine Ultimate Alternate," that can just replace the higher quality version used in the X2UP itself that only has 1 pose. It's already set to the correct filename.
