This is a list of what SVS concept art (AKA the concept art for the Extra Credit Danger Room missions) is used, what isn't, and what all of it is. 
Because of the limit of how much concept art can be unlocked, you will have to change file names if you want the unused stuff to show up in the Review Menu.
All of it is in your X-Men Legends II\Textures\loading folder. 
Just change the file names to match the used concept art. 
(You can also do this to switch which concept art appears during the end credits. You don't need to do anything with review_paths if you're doing that.) 
Then find the entry for that file in review_paths and change the filename to match.
