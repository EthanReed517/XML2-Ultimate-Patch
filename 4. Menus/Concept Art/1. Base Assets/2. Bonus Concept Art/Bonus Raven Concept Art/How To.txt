Below are the review entries for the bonus concept art if you wish to use any of those.

They have pre-named them for which used concept art they are the best fit for.

(Except for Jubilee, Magma, and Psylocke. They're special cases. Rename their files match of the playable characters' concept art files and then rename those characters' review_paths concept art entry to match.)

Copy the files to X-Men Legends II/Textures/comic and agree to override.

Then, find the one you just installed in the list below and replace the review_paths entry with the one with the same filename.

If the one you installed isn't on the list below, it's because its name doesn't need to change.
