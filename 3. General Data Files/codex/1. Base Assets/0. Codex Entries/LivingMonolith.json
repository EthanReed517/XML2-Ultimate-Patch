            "description": "\t Ahmet Abdol was a professor of ancient Egyptology whose theories that the gods and pharaohs of old were the first recorded mutants drew much controversy. Tragedy struck Abdol when a mob attacked him in the streets of Cairo whilst out with his wife and infant daughter. His family perished in a car crash and the angry mob looked on, unaffected by what had transpired. Enraged, Abdol discovered he had the ability to manipulate and absorb cosmic energy, and used his new powers on the crowd in retribution. Convinced by Apocalypse to join him, Abdol received further genetic enhancements by Mister Sinister from Havok's DNA. He took up the name of the Living Monolith and used his drawn power from the sun to enact his will.",
