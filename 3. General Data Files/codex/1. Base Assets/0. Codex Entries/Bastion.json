This being was found and adopted into the care of a woman named Rose Gilberti, who treated him as the son she never had and gave him the name of Sebastion. His prime directives soon reawakened upon hearing numerous stories of America's mutant problem. He took up the codename of Bastion and set to work on dealing with the global mutant menace. Outfitted with cybernetic nanite enhancements expected of any Sentinel robot, he has proven to be one of the X-Men's most persistently dangerous and lethal foes.",
