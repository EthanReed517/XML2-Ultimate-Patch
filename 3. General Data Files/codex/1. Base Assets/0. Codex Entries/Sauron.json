            "description": "\t In his previous life, Karl Lykos was a psychiatrist. The creature known as Sauron was born when he was attacked by mutant pteranodons from the Savage Land as a child. One of them severely bit Karl before it fled. He now required the life force of others to survive. A chance encounter with the X-Men in adulthood provided him the opportunity to absorb Havokâ€™s lifeforce, ending with Karl being mutated into a pteranodon himself. He retained his intellect and speaking capability at the price of his morals completely eroding. Possessing a wide assortment of abilities from energy blasts and fire breath to hypnotic eyes and enhanced superhuman capabilities, Sauron is a creature that should be approached cautiously, lest you become his next meal.",
