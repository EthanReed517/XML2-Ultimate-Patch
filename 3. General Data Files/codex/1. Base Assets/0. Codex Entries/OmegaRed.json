He was forced into the Russian supersoldier program against his will after his crimes were uncovered and used as a tool by the KGB for their own ends. The KGB armed him with carbonadium tentacles within his arms which could be applied to a multitude of situations and granted him enhanced superhuman capabilities. They had a failsafe in place to counter Arkady's powers via a custom built synthesizer. Joining Apocalypse in the hopes of a cure and keeping the poisoning effects of the carbonadium at bay, he does whatever he pleases to satisfy his new master's demands and achieve his prime goals.",
