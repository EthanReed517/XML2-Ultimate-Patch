            "description": "\t The Stepford Cuckoos were created by the twisted Weapon Plus program from Emma Frost's harvested eggs. The triplets were eventually discovered by the Hellfire Club and taken under their birth mother's wing. Eventually, Frost cut ties after becoming disillusioned with the Hellfire Club's affairs and joined her former enemies, the X-Men. The Cuckoos were greatly disgusted by their mother choosing to side with the enemy. They were brought to Apocalypse's attention and gladly joined him for a chance at vengeance for Emma's betrayal. Possessing the same vast psychic capabilities as their mother with further amplification by Mister Sinister, the Stepford Cuckoos align themselves for what they deem as their true calling.",
