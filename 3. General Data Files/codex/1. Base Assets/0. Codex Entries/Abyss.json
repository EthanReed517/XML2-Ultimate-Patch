            "description": "\t Little was known of Abyss' life before he became a Horseman of Apocalypse. It was said Abyss was experimented upon in Sinister's labs, but escaped. Rather than have Abyss killed, Apocalypse was impressed and appointed him as his new Horseman. Since then, Abyss has helped Apocalypse to crush the resistance in Genosha.\\n\t Abyss is terrifying and powerful. His body is made up of strong coils that he can extend to attack his enemies, and he has a portal to another dimension in his chest. In addition to that, he can draw power from the fear of others. His reputation for cruelty is renowned among Apocalypse's forces.",
