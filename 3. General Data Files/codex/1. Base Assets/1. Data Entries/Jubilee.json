            "description": "\t Born in Beverly Hills, California, Jubilee had it all - loving parents, a wealthy lifestyle, and plenty of friends. But in the span of several days, her parents lost all their money in the stock market and then lost their lives to assassins. Jubilee was taken to a juvenile hall. Eventually, she ran away to live in a shopping mall, where she stole whatever she needed. The mall hired mutant hunters to track her down, but fortunately the X-Men were there to stop them.\\n\t Jubilee's mutant power is the ability to generate bright energy from her fingertips, which she refers to as fireworks. Initially, she could only blind people for a short amount of time with her powers. As she grew more adept, she learned to control the energy and direct it to explode on any object.",
