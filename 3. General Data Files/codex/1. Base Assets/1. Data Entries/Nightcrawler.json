            "description": "\t As a baby, Kurt Wagner was raised in a traveling circus. Despite his demonic appearance, they accepted him as an equal. As he grew older and took to performing as an acrobat under the name Nightcrawler, audiences assumed he was a normal person dressed in a costume. Eventually, he was accused of being a devil by a mob. Professor X arrived just in time to save Kurt's life and invited Kurt to join the X-Men.\\n\t Capable of teleporting great distances in an instant and gifted with amazing acrobatic skills, the charming Nightcrawler is the team's moral compass. Kurt knows from experience how cruel the world can be, yet he strives to see the humanity in those who refuse to recognize it in him and will always fight for Professor X's dream of peaceful coexistence.",
