            "description": "\t Little is known about the early life of the feral mutant named Victor Creed. His memory was tampered with when he was coerced into joining the Weapon X program. There, he encountered Wolverine.\\n\t Sabretooth is ferocious and cunning. His mutant abilities give him an amazing healing ability and extremely acute senses. His deeply animalistic side leads him to revel in violence and destruction. Thanks to the sharp talons on his hands, he is incredibly brutal in combat.\\n\t Sabretooth and Wolverine would meet many more times through their lives, always clashing violently. The two are bitter rivals and almost equally matched in combat. The outcome of their battles is never certain, but one can be assured the battle will be fierce, and neither side will yield.",
