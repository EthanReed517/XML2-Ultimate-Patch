He existed as a redundant anomaly but was led to believe that he was the original and not the clone. Stryfe was taken in by the Apocalypse of his timeline and raised to be his heir. Apocalypse planned to take Stryfe's body for himself when the time came. Uncovering Apocalypse's deception, Stryfe used his vast psychic abilities to escape and later followed Cable into the past. Using the past Apocalypse as a tool for his own ends, he chooses to play along and puts his decades of combat experience to use against anyone who would try to fight the will of his master.",
