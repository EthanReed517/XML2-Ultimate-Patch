            "description": "\t Though his name is a mystery, Deadpool has been known to use the name Wade T. Wilson. His identity was lost when he joined the Weapon X program in hopes that they would cure his cancer.\\n\t The Weapon X Project did give him an immense healing factor - to the point where he can regenerate severed limbs and damaged organs, including his heart. But it also permanently scarred his face, forcing him to wear a mask.\\n\t Deadpool has an odd, disjointed way of speaking, cracking jokes in even the most intense battles. It's unknown whether this is to throw off his opponents or if it's the result of Weapon X meddling with his mind. What is known is that despite his penchant for pop culture references and one liners, Deadpool is an assassin who is not to be taken lightly.",
