            "description": "\t Nathaniel Grey was born in an alternate universe where Apocalypse rose to power much sooner with no X-Men to stop him. Mister Sinister created him from the genetic material of Scott Summers and Jean Grey as a weapon to destroy Apocalypse. Nate eventually escaped from Sinister's lab and was trained by mutant outcasts in his reality. During a battle with Holocaust, one of Apocalypse's horsemen, he was teleported to this reality by the M'Kraan Crystal.\\n\t Much like his mother, Nate is a powerful telepath and telekinetic. Some even consider him to be one of the most powerful mutants in existence. He hopes to use his vast power to prevent Apocalypse from coming to power and dominating this reality.",
