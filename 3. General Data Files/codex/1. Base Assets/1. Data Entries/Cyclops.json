Scott received a head injury in the fall and began to suffer severe headaches and eyestrain.\\n\t In his teens, Scott's mutant power erupted in an uncontrollable optic blast. Shortly after, Professor Xavier enlisted Scott as the first member of the X-Men. Scott discovered that he was unable to control his mutant power, but Professor Xavier created a special ruby quartz visor that allowed Scott to control his optic blasts. Soon after, Scott was given the code name of Cyclops.\\n\t Cyclops quickly assumed command of the X-Men. His teammates have come to rely heavily on him, and he has never shirked his duty to the team he considers to be his family.",
