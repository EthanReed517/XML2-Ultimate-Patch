            "description": "\t Dr. Henry McCoy is a mutant of vast intellect and a world-class geneticist. From childhood, he had always possessed oversized hands and feet and an apelike agility. In college, he became a football star and earned the nickname 'Beast' for his physical appearance. He was noticed by Professor Charles Xavier, who invited McCoy to become the fourth member of his original team of X-Men.\\n\t Beast quickly assumed the role of the team's technical expert in addition to going on missions in the field. Not only does he maintain the X-Men's equipment, but he also upgrades it when a new idea strikes him. A gentleman and scholar, it is a rare time when Beast is not seen either tinkering with the insides of complex computer hardware or staring intently at a heavy textbook.",
