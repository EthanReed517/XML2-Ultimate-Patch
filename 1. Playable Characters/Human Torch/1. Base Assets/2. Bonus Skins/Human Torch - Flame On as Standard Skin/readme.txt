This allows you to use Human Torch's Flame On skin swap skin as a standard skin. It was made by Enigma.

To use this, rename whichever version of the skin you want to use to whichever skin you want to replace it with, place the igb file in the skin folder and overwrite the original.

Then, rename the 3D head to match the number you gave the skin, place the igb file in the ui\hud\characters folder and overwrite the original.

Then, rename the hud to match the number you gave the skin, place the igb file in the hud folder and overwrite the original.
