            "description": "\t As his heavy accent can attest, Pyro comes from Australia. Born as St. John Allerdyce, he drifted around the world to find his place before encountering Mystique, who invited him to join the Brotherhood of Mutants. He accepted and helped the Brotherhood in numerous devious schemes, including an attempted assassination of Senator Kelly, an anti-mutant activist.\\n\t Pyro is capable of mentally controlling fire. This allows him to move fire in any direction or change its size and shape almost instantly. He is able to make the flame of a match grow to a raging inferno. Though he cannot generate fire himself, Pyro wears a flamethrower on his back with which he can create all types of mayhem, from fireballs that act like guided missiles to impenetrable walls of flame.",
