Later in life, Erik traveled to Israel, where he befriended Charles Xavier. The two realized their views of the future differed greatly. Charles believed that humans and mutants could peacefully coexist, but Erik foresaw mutants becoming a persecuted minority and was unwilling to watch history repeat itself.\\n\t Determined to prevent the oppression of mutantkind, Erik became Magneto and set forth to conquer the human race. Just as Charles formed the X-Men, Magneto formed the Brotherhood of Mutants and over the years, the two groups have violently clashed. Each man hopes he can convince the other to see his side.",
