His ability to transform his body into an organic metal makes him much bigger and stronger. He discovered his powers when a runaway tractor threatened to crush his sister. Piotr rushed to save her and turned to steel, stopping the tractor with his strength.\\n\t Shortly after this event, Professor Xavier came to Russia and persuaded Peter to join the X-Men. Peter accepted the invitation and was given the codename Colossus.\\n\t Peter is close friends with all his teammates, but he holds a special place in his heart for Kitty Pryde - Shadowcat. Their relationship has led some of their teammates to speculate what the future has in store for them.",
