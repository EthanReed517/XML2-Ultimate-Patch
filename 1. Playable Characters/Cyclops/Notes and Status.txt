To do:
- Create templates from all compilers
- Add special condition to Cyclops for his visors

Needs:
- Update script for tutorial1, sanctuary, infinite factory Sinister, and briefings
  - These maps will need the existing convo portrait hex edited out on consoles
- Compiler script
  - Need special routine for the visor boltons
  - Don't implement redesign or custom skins yet
  - CSP, sounds, loading, comics are not part of this compiler; update script only

Default assets:
- GameCube is missing skins and 3D heads
- PSP:
  - Currently using original PSP assets, 0106 and 0109 are duplicates of 0101
  - No updated icons
  - No boltons
  - No skin-specific portraits and they are not updated
  - Lacks extra loading screens, uses duplicates, is not updated
  - Comic cover is not updated
