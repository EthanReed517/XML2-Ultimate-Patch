Her life was flipped upside down when the X-Men rescued her from the clutches of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. She was trained in the use of her powers and chose the codename 'Magma', going on to help the X-Men stop the Brotherhood from covering the earth in asteroids, and later preventing Asteroid M from crashing into New York.\\n\t Magma is incredibly powerful, being able to manipulate the earth's crust and control rocks, fire, and lava. When using her powers, she can turn into a 'magma form' that grants her increased strength and durability. Magma is a valuable addition to the X-Men and a dedicated hero who hopes to use her abilities to better the world.",
