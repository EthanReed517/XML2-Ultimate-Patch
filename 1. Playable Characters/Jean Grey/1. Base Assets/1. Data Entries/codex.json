            "description": "\t Jean Grey was referred to Professor X as a child after seeing her best friend killed in a car accident, which kickstarted her telepathic abilities. Later, her parents enrolled her in Professor Xavier's School. It was then she also became the fifth member of the X-Men and used the code name Marvel Girl.\\n\t In addition to being telepathic, Jean has learned she is also telekinetic - she can move objects with her thoughts. Jean must always be cautious about the use of her powers, as overexerting herself can cause her to manifest her malevolent alter ego - The Phoenix.\\n\t As she worked with the X-Men, Jean realized she harbored strong feelings for Cyclops. For years, both were too shy to express their emotions, but that has changed and the two now have a strong relationship.",
