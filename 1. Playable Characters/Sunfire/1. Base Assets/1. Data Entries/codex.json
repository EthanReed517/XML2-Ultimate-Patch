            "description": "\t At the close of World War II, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and the intense radiation from that blast altered the genes of  Shiro Yoshida's mother. She died in childbirth, and Shiro was raised by his fanatically anti-American uncle. Working under the code name Sunfire, Shiro swore to have vengeance on the United States. Though the X-Men stopped him from destroying the Capitol building, it wasn't until the death of his father that Sunfire would give up his need for revenge.\\n\t Sunfire has the ability to absorb radiation and generate intense plasma blasts, which he can also use to fly or shield himself from harm. He works primarily as a superhero in Japan as part of Big Hero 6, but he has aided the X-Men from time to time.",
