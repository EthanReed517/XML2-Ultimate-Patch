While she was still a child, a bomb destroyed their home, killing her parents.\\n\t Left alone and living in the streets, Ororo became an accomplished pickpocket. When she was 12, Ororo felt a strong urge to reconnect with her ancestoral homeland. When her mutant abilities manifested, she used her weather manipulation powers to aid the local tribes, who worshipped her as a goddess. Professor X convinced her to join the X-Men so that she could use her powers to benefit the entire world. One with the Earth, Storm truly understands the sanctity of life and feels a strong obligation to help preserve it in all its forms.",
