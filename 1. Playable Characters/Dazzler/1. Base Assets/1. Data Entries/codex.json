            "description": "\t Allison Blaire never wanted to be a super hero. She grew up wanting to be an entertainer, much to the chagrin of her father, a judge. Despite his objections, Allison began performing as 'Dazzler' when her mutant powers manifested. Her fame drew both the X-Men and the Hellfire Club to her. While the X-Men tried to recruit her, the Hellfire Club made an attempt to kidnap her. The X-Men were able to save her, but she turned down a position with them to focus on her career. She did eventually join the team on several occasions.\\n\t Dazzler has the ability to convert sound directly into light. She can project this light in a variety of ways, from harmless bursts that dazzle the fans at her performances to powerful beams she can use to attack enemies.",
