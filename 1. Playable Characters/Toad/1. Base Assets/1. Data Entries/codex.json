            "description": "\t Born in England, Mortimer Toynbee has been considered a freak since he was a child. Having a distinctly amphibious appearance, he was mockingly called Toad and shunned by society. Consumed by his low self-esteem, Mortimer joined the only group that would have him - The Brotherhood of Mutants. Toad came to regard their leader, Magneto, as his master. Though Magneto and the rest of the Brotherhood treat him like a buffoon, Toad holds fast to his allegiance to the group and willingly carries out any order they give him.\\n\t Though Toad may be somewhat of a comical figure, his battle skills are quite impressive. He is an incredibly agile fighter and can leap vast distances. He can also use his tongue like a whip and project poisonous spit.",
