            "description": "\t The son of a wealthy industrialist, Tony Stark was an inventive prodigy. At the age of 21 he inherited his father's company, transforming it into one of the world's leading weapons manufacturers.\\n\t While field-testing weapons, he was struck in the chest by shrapnel and grievously wounded. He was then taken prisoner by a warlord and ordered to create a weapon of mass destruction in exchange for the operations needed to save his life. Wearing a battle suit that was fortified with weaponry, Stark broke free and returned to America.\\n\t Once he was back in the States, Stark redesigned the battle suit and became Iron Man. At first, Iron Man was little more than a glorified security guard, but over time, he has grown to become a member of the Avengers and a global hero.",
