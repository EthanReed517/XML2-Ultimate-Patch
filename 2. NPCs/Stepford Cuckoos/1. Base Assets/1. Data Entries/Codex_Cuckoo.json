            "description": "\t The Stepford Cuckoos were created by the twisted Weapon Plus program from Emma Frost's harvested eggs. The quadruplets were eventually discovered by the X-Men and were taken under their birth mother's wing. While at the Xavier Institute, one of the sisters was killed during a mission. Blaming Emma for her death, the Stepfords left the school. Possessing the same vast psychic capabilities as their mother, these abilities drew Apocalypse's attention. They gladly joined him for a chance at revenge for their fallen sister and received further amplification of their powers by Mister Sinister, turning these former X-Men into truly formidable opponents.",
