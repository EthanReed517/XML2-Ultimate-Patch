            "description": "\t In the mid 1800's, a scientist named Nathaniel Essex argued that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution should be used to transform the human race. Essex felt that the breeding of humans should be carefully controlled in order to produce genetically superior children. This, he felt, would guarantee that the human race would evolve to be stronger. Everyone was appalled at the notion, except for Apocalypse.\\n\t Essex and Apocalypse found they agreed on a great many things - so much so that Apocalypse turned Essex into a superhuman creature who is practically immortal. It was then he took on the name Mister Sinister. Since then, Mister Sinister has aided Apocalypse in his schemes to take over the world while pursuing his own twisted genetic experiments.",
