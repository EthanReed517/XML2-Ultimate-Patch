            "description": "\t Holocaust is by far the most trustworthy of Apocalypse's Horsemen. His devotion to Apocalypse is above reproach, and he would willingly lay down his life to protect his master. For that devotion, he is often entrusted with the most valuable of Apocalypse's schemes.\\n\t His mutant powers include the ability to feed off the life force of others. If he is able to store up enough energy, some say he would be able to decimate an entire planet. Brave and cunning, Holocaust knows no fear and cannot be bribed. This perhaps makes him the most dangerous of all Apocalypse's lieutenants.",
