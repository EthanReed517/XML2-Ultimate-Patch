            "description": "\t Ensnared while on a scouting mission in Apocalypse's Tower, Warren Worthington III had his DNA radically altered by Mister Sinister. The resulting experiment turned his skin blue and changed his wings into a type of bio-metallic substance. He is able to generate razor sharp blades from these wings that he hurls at his opponents.\\n\t But even more serious than the changes to his body are the alterations to his mind. Under the effects of Mister Sinister's drugs, he now swears his allegiance to Apocalypse and vows death to the X-Men. He has changed his name from Angel to Archangel and stands as Death, the fourth Horseman - a loyal and trustworthy aid to Apocalypse.",
