            "description": "\t The sadistic creature known as Sugar Man originated from an alternate reality where Apocalypse ruled the world with an iron fist. He took great pleasure in experimenting and torturing any subjects he got his hands on. He escaped to this timeline after the X-Men of his world tried to set things back to normal by entering a piece of the M'kraan Crystal. He found himself flung back into the past before his old master's knees. Accepted into Apocalypse's ranks as easily as before, Sugar Man ensued to not let this second chance go to waste. Possessing size alteration abilities, a healing factor, a surprisingly strong elongated tongue, and multiple arms which can hold a variety of weapons, Sugar Man is a very dangerous foe that should never be underestimated.",
