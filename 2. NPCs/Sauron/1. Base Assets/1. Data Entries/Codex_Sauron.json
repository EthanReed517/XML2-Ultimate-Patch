            "description": "\t As a child, Karl Lykos was attacked by pteranodons from the Savage Land. One of them severely bit him before it fled, and as a result, Karl now needed to drain the life force of others to survive. He went onto become a hypnotherapist, using his talents to drain his patients. A chance encounter with the X-Men in adulthood provided him the opportunity to absorb Havokâ€™s lifeforce which resulted in Karl being mutated into a pteranodon himself. He retained his intellect and speaking capability at the price of his morals completely eroding. Now calling himself Sauron, he has tried numerous times to take over the Savage Land and been thwarted each time by its protectors, Ka-Zar and Shanna. Now as Apocalypse's forces arrive, Sauron has refused their offer to join them, seeing them only as competition. Possessing a wide assortment of abilities from psychic energy blasts and fire breath to hypnotic eyes and enhanced superhuman capabilities, Sauron is a creature that should be approached cautiously, lest you become his next meal.",
