            "description": "\t When Master Mold absorbed Nimrod, an advanced prototype Sentinel that arrived in this world from an alternate universe, it created a human-Sentinel hybrid being who initially suffered from amnesia. After escaping the Sentinel factory, he wandered lost and confused until he was found and adopted by a woman named Rose Gilberti, who treated him as the son she never had and gave him the name of Sebastion. His prime directives soon reawakened upon hearing numerous stories of the atrocities committed by the mutant Apocalypse and his forces during their takeover of the world. He took up the codename of Bastion and set to work dealing with the global mutant menace. After seeing the Sentinels had been reactivated and sent to rescue refugees, Bastion sees an opportunity to take control of them and set them back to their true purpose of eliminating all mutant life. Outfitted with cybernetic nanite enhancements expected of any Sentinel robot, he will prove to be a dangerous and formidable foe.",
