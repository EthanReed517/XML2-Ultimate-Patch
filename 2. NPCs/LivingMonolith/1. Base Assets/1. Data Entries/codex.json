            "description": "\t Ahmet Abdol was a professor of ancient Egyptology whose theories that the gods and pharaohs of old were the first recorded mutants drew much controversy. So much so that, when he announced his findings, an angry mob chased him through the streets of Cairo. Attempting to escape with his wife and infant daughter, tragedy struck when Abdol's car crashed, and his family perished as the mob looked on, unaffected by what had transpired. Enraged, Abdol discovered he had the ability to manipulate and absorb cosmic energy and used his new powers to take revenge on the crowd. Convinced by Apocalypse to join him, Abdol was placed by Apocalypse as his last line of defense in his Giza stronghold. Renaming himself the Living Monolith, he uses the crystals stored in the pyramid to draw power from the sun and use it to grow to great heights, crushing all who oppose his will.",
