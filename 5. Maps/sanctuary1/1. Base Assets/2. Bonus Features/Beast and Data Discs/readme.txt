This is an alternate version of Beast's conversation in the Act 1 Sanctuary hub that replaces Beast's "You're the smartest X-Man, aren't you?" with an unused unvoiced "What's a data disc?" dialogue option. The lines weren't finished being written but have been done so by BaconWizard17. This was made by BaconWizard17 and Enigma.

To use this, place the file in the conversations\act1\sanctuary folder and overwrite the original.
